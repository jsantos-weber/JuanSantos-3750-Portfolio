# Connect 4 Game
In class we were able to create a Connect 4 game using **React**. This involved creating both a front end and a back end. React was a new language and the skills adopted during the creation were all newly devleoped. 
## The Front End 
### As an introduction to React, we created a tic-tac-toe game that I then transformed into a Connect 4 game.

### As part of the implementation, I designed the game pieces to "drop" down to the lowest point available on the board as shown below:

### I also displayed the high scores list as a seperate page that we routed to

## The Back End stored data in a Mongo Database which housed things such as high scores.

### I created a connection to a Mongo Database which housed the data from the high scores. We used environment variables to accomplish this
