# JuanSantos-3750-Portfolio
This is the portfolio for the assignments made for the CS 3750 class for the Summer 2023 semester. During this class we learned the MERN method of creating a Front and Back End system. We learned how to implement a front end that can communicate with a backend and store data inside of Mongo Databases. This was the highlight of the semester as being able to communicate between the two proved to be challenging and very educational. 

# Connect 4 Game
In class we were able to create a Connect 4 game using **React**. This involved creating both a front end and a back end. React was a new language and the skills adopted during the creation were all newly devleoped.

# Speed (Group Project)
This was a group project that combined the efforts of 3 developers to build a web-based version of the popular card game Speed. Although we were not able to finish the project during the course of the semester, we were able to build most of the functionality using sockets.
