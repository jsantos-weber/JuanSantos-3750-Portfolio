# Connect 4 Game
In class we were able to create a Connect 4 game using **React**. 
## The Front End 
As an introduction to React, we created a tic-tac-toe game that we then transformed into a Connect 4 game.

As part of the implementation, we designed the game pieces to "drop" down to the lowest point available on the board as shown below:

## The Back End stored data in a Mongo Database which housed things such as high scores.
